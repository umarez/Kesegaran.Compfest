## Compfest Software Engineering Task

This is a boilerplate which includes:

- `/graphql/` - this folder is to define your Queries/Mutations (pro tip: copy the Query/Mutation from your `GraphiQL` to avoid errors)
- `npm run gen` or `yarn gen` to generate the types from the Query/Mutation (or you can just use `npm dev` or `yarn dev` as it also runs this command first)

Prerequisites

1. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
